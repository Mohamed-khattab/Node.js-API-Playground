# Node.js API Playground

Welcome to my Node.js API Playground! This repository contains two APIs that I have built while learning and practicing with Node.js: Book App API and Notes App API.

## Description

Each API is a separate project with its own folder and includes all the necessary files to run the API locally. Both APIs have been well-tested using Postman, and are designed to be user-friendly and easy to modify.

## Usage

Feel free to explore, clone, and modify any of the projects in this repository. If you have any feedback or suggestions for improvement, please don't hesitate to open an issue or submit a pull request.

### Book App API

The Book App API allows users to search for and retrieve information about books. It uses the Google Books API to search for books by title, author, or keyword, and returns information such as the book's title, author, and cover image. The API also allows users to create, update, and delete book entries in a PostgreSQL database with multiple stores.

To get started with the Book App API, simply navigate to the `book-app-api` folder and follow the instructions in the README file.

### Notes App API

The Notes App API allows users to create, update, and delete notes in a local memstorage. It uses the Express framework to handle HTTP requests, and includes support for creating and managing user accounts with secure password authentication.

To get started with the Notes App API, simply navigate to the `notes-app-api` folder and follow the instructions in the README file.
