# Node.js API Playground

Welcome to my Node.js API Playground! This repository contains two APIs that I have built while learning and practicing with Node.js: Book App API and Notes App API.

## Description

Each API is a separate project with its own folder and includes all the necessary files to run the API locally. Both APIs have been well-tested using Postman, and are designed to be user-friendly and easy to modify.

## Usage

Feel free to explore, clone, and modify any of the projects in this repository. If you have any feedback or suggestions for improvement, please don't hesitate to open an issue or submit a pull request.

### Book App API

The Book App API allows users to create, read, update, and delete books and stores in a PostgreSQL database. Users can also add multiple books to a store, retrieve all books in a store, and search for books by title or author.

To get started with the Book App API, simply navigate to the `app-book` folder and follow the instructions in the README file.

### Notes App API

The Notes App API allows users to create, read, update, and delete notes in a local memstorage. The API is built using the Express framework and does not include authentication or encryption features.

To get started with the Notes App API, simply navigate to the `app-notes` folder and follow the instructions in the README file.
